This program reads a csv file and searches for errors and then gets modified 
after modifcations then the persons list gets put into a dictonary then the dictionary gets 
returned to the main function. In the main function the dictionary is saved as a pickle file then check if its unpickled correctly.

#explain how to run it
to run this program, open the ternminal and type "python Assignment1.py data\data.csv"
then modifiy the phone numbers, ids, etc. to the correct formatting as indicated 

#write a couple of sentences describing the strengths/weaknesses of Python for text processing, in your opinion
Some strengths of Python for text processing in the useful libraries that can be imported to do a functionality, like pickling used in 
this proogram but moreover, when it comes to text processing, python has libraries like nltk, tokenize, stopwords 
specifically for preprocessing of text. We can split up raw text into tokens, sentence tokens, letters, remove stopwords. I really 
like Python for text processing. 

#write a couple of sentences describing what you learned in this assignment, or what was a review for you
What I learned from this assignment was how to write a sys argv in the ternimal which honestly took me a long time to figure out what 
sys.argv[0] and sys.argv[1]. How to make a dictionary and put it into a pickle file and unpickle it. I also learned how to do 
simple functionalities I know in java like try/catch, while loops, if statements and reading and writing files in Python.
