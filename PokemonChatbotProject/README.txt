GenKnowledgeBase - Run this only if you want to test the Knowledge Base generation. As there is already one provided, this is not a required step. If you do run it, a counter will appear. When it reaches 151, the program has finished running

Professor_Oak - This is the Chatbot. Run it with the Knowledge Base and the Users file in the same directory. Note that the setup questions, such as username and starter selection, are case senesitive, but the remaining ones are not. Also, apostraphes and plurals can cause issues with query parsing when they are attached to a pokemon name (for example, Charizard's and Charizards will not work, but Charizard will). Otherwise, they are fine in the rest of the query.

trainer_data - run this to see a summary of all the User Models currently being saved. Like with Professor_Oak, this will only work if the Users.p file is in the same directory
